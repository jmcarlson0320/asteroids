essential fuctions
    enemy ship
        modify test state to run enemy code
        model
        logic
        enemy targeting
            calculate angle +/- some random amount
    highscore
        display asteroids behind scores, like the title screen
refactor
    consistent state change code
        sometimes the previous state initializes for the next state, other times the new state initializes itself
        states should initialize themselves. if they need to know which state was previous, look at the gamestate variable in the game context
        during initialization, the current state sets the gamestate variable.
        initialize means setup the game context
    replace magic numbers with constants
extra features
    wf_util
        at program start
            if file given as argument exists, load that file for editing
            if file doesn't exist, create a new file
