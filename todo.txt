    consistent state change code
        sometimes the previous state initializes for the next state, other times the new state initializes itself
        states should initialize themselves. if they need to know which state was previous, look at the gamestate variable in the game context
        during initialization, the current state sets the gamestate variable.
        initialize means setup the game context
    replace magic numbers with constants
